# Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is one of the basic machine learning algorithms. It's a step forward after you learn linear regression. Before we dive in, I would like to review some basic ideas in linear regression.

## Linear regression
Linear regression is one of the algorithms used to solve regression problems, for example, you want to predict the house price, given some basic properties of houses. First we vectorize these properties, and combine such vector with the house's true price to get our training data. 

Concretely, say we are given the __size__, __rooms__, __age__ and __price__

__First Step__

x1 = [size, house, age]      
y1 = [price]

__Second Step__

data1 = [x1, y1]
